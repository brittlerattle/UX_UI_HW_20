  <br><br><h1> About Me:</h1>
 
  <br>Denver-based UX/UI designer with a passion for solving problems and a flare for visual design. I became interested in UX/UI during my time as a video and photo processor; when my focus on the  productivity of my creative software brought me to a point where I found myself obsessively reprogramming and reimagining all of my input devices, as well as iterating my workflow to optimize all ten fingers and every inch of monitor space, I realized I was far more interested in solving interface and usability problems than I was color grading and culling.
  <br><br>
  
      I enrolled in The University of Denver UX/UI Bootcamp and earned my certificate in 2022.

      <br>
      I earned my undergraduate degree from Metro State University of Denver with a Bachelor of Fine Art in Digital Art. I made Provost List and graduated Cum Laude in three years.
<br><br>
      After school, I earned a living doing freelance logo design, photo editing and some print design. Not long after,  a one-time wedding processing gig turned into a full time contract, and I found myself in that role for the next 7 years.
      <br><br>
      When the COVID-19 pandemic canceled every wedding for the season, I used the downtime to assess what my true career goals were, and realized that as much as I loved working with photographers; optimizing workflow and solving design problems was what I most loved about creative work. Looking to find something that would better satisfy my strengths, I was recommended to check out UX/UI by a developer friend who was familiar with my talents, and soon after, I enrolled in a UX/UI Bootcamp at The University of Denver.
